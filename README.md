# Match%

Match% is basically a dating site that will use data from external sources (that users already have) in order to better match them with people who "empirically" have similar interests or compatibility in some form. 

# Screenshots (Mockup)
Screenshots say "Date%" because they are from the earlier planning stage and don't reflect the current state of the application. However, I'm using these because I don't want to keep updating these screenshots as the actual site starts to look more and more like the mockup from the planning stage. As of writing this readme, I am in the middle of styling so a lot of things are changing very frequently.

# Next Steps

- Remake the models so that everything is just in one user model rather than splitting information between user and profile models. This will make everything a lot simpler and easier to enact other changes.

- Allow photo upload

- Like, Dislike, & Match functionality

- Messages functionality

- Filter by gender preferance on profile list page

- Exclude active user's profile from profile list page

- Fix profile edit form deleting values left blank on accepting changes

- Redirect to Auth Page after deleting user

- Change index page to show one profile at a time rather than all of them at once (unless all at once is a design choice?)

- Support more than one picture where you can scroll through them in a row where the first one is currently

- Include data from APIs (YouTube, Steam, Spotify, etc.) to calculate compatibility percentages

- Make the header and Like/Dislike buttons "sticky" so they stay on the screen when scrolling someone's profile (unless design choice?)

- Resize/redo the like & dislike buttons
